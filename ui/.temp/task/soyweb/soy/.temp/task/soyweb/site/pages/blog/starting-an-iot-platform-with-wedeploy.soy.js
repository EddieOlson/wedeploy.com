I believe the IoT train is passing and if we don\'t get on, we will miss out. That\'s why I decided to explore more.</p><figure><img src="../images/blog/post-6--0.jpg" alt="IoT train is passing. Credits: Amos Bar-Zeev (https://unsplash.com/search/wait?photo=IjA4vTJ3PHY)"></figure><p>I realized that in the short period of time I had to accomplish this, I would need to learn how to use and configure a complete new tool like <a href="https://www.kaaproject.org">Kaa</a> or <a href="https://macchina.io">Machina.io</a>. But I just wanted a place to simulate an IoT platform super fast. Then a thought occured to me:</p><blockquote><p>Why not use WeDeploy to host my app? It already provides all the infrastructure I need.</p></blockquote><p>With WeDeploy, you manage <code>git</code> repositories and wrap them into services that can be deployed into the platform. It also offers a set of useful, already-configured services such as <a href="/docs/data">Data</a>, <a href="/docs/auth">Users and Auth</a>, or even a <a href="/docs/email">E-mail</a>. This allows any developer to streamline a project with minimal infrastructure configuration so they can just focus on coding the application they want to develop.</p><h4>The Stack</h4><p>So, here are the requirements for my project:</p><ul><li>An Android app that reads current speeds from a GPS and sends it each time the current location is changed.</li><li>A server that reads the metrics sent by the Android app and stores them into persistent storage.</li><li>A web interface to display the metrics stored in the database, reading from the server.</li></ul><p>The Android app is super easy to create, and has nothing to do with WeDeploy, just knowing the URL of the server where to send the metrics, so I won\'t go anymore into it. <strong>The two things that really matter</strong> are related to the API I wanted to create to accept the metrics sent by the devices and the visualisation of those metrics.</p><h4>Creating an API with WeDeploy</h4><p>In order to accept metrics from remote applications, I decided to create a REST API to handle the requests, and then it would store the metrics in a persistent storage. As WeDeploy offers a <a href="/docs/data">Data</a> service, I decided that my REST API should communicate to that service to store the metrics.</p><p>Then, I chose the framework to create the API. As I\'m a Java developer, I chose <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> to build it, which lets you create tiny applications and define REST resources in an extremely easy manner.</p><p>So I created a project on the WeDeploy dashboard, and added a <a href="/docs/other/java.html">WeDeploy Java</a> service named &quot;api&quot;. I locally cloned <a href="https://github.com/wedeploy/boilerplate-java">the boilerplate-java project from Github</a>, and started coding my REST API\'s there.</p><p>Of course you can do this step with other technology you are more familiar with, and WeDeploy offers several server-side technologies to accomplish this including <a href="/docs/other/nodejs.html">NodeJS</a> and <a href="/docs/other/ruby.html">Ruby</a>.</p><h5>Implementing a service</h5><p>In order to implement a WeDeploy service, it\'s mandatory to create a <code>container.json</code> file in the root of your folder, where you specify the type of the service you would like to use and some other behaviors.</p><p>In the case of the <a href="/docs/other/java.html">WeDeploy Java</a> service, you can set hooks to build the project once the service is created or updated.</p>' + ElectricCode.render({code: soydata.$$markUnsanitizedTextForInternalBlocks('{\n    "id": "api",\n    "type": "wedeploy/java:latest",\n    "hooks": {\n        "build": "gradle -Dorg.gradle.native=false clean build -x test"\n    }\n}'), mode: 'application/json'}, null, opt_ijData) + '<p>In this case, because I used a <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> project, the build system is based on <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, so I added the commands to build the project, excluding tests.</p><h5>Defining REST resources</h5><p>The following block of code demonstrates how to handle HTTP <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests in a <code>Spring Boot</code> controller.</p>' + ElectricCode.render({code: soydata.$$markUnsanitizedTextForInternalBlocks('/**\n * We\'ll handle all HTTP request to the path \'/sensors\' under application context path\n * @author Manuel de la Pe\u00F1a\n */\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping("/sensors")\npublic class SensorsRestController {\n\n    /*\n    * Defines the resource for an specific sensor, identified by its sensorId,\n    * which is passed as input parameter to the method, using the annotation @PathVariable.\n    * It allows CORS requests from any domain.\n    * @return A collection of model domain objects\n    */\n    @CrossOrigin(origins = "*")\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/{sensorId}")\n    public Collection<SensorRow> getMetrics(@PathVariable String sensorId) {...}\n    ...\n    /*\n    * Define the resource for POST verb operations over this controller\'s path.\n    * The annotation @RequestBody indicates the type of the object that will be\n    * processed in the request.\n    * It allows CORS requests from any domain.\n    */\n    @CrossOrigin(origins = "*")\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)\n    public ResponseEntity<?> addMetric(@RequestBody Metric metric) {...}\n    ...\n}'), mode: 'text/x-java'}, null, opt_ijData) + '<h5>Defining the save service</h5><p>Our API service needs to store the metrics in the <a href="/docs/data">WeDeploy Data</a> service so I added a new service to the project on the WeDeploy dashboard, naming it <code>data</code>.
