But first, a little backstory.

#### Where we've come

XXX days ago, we launched the first app on WeDeploy. It was such an exhilarating time but we had our eyes set on the future.

The thing is, WeDeploy didn't start as "WeDeploy". Almost two years ago, me and a few others spent our spare time working on this project called _Launchpad_. It was just a shadow of what WeDeploy is today, but it was a start. It was *our* start.

After that first app was deployed, we got right back to work. Yes, we had acheived something, but it still had a lot of room to grow. We needed to challenge our own mindset and imagination in order to create a project that would not just help people, but could change the way people develop modern apps. We believe that this release puts WeDeploy that much closer to our goal.

Now introducing, **WeDeploy Beta: A tagline about the Beta release!**
