Since then, we have been exploring new ways to take the WeDeploy learning experience to the next level, which is why we are excited to announce a brand new sibling in the documentation family: Tutorials.

#### Why tutorials?

We felt that, although traditional documentation provides a necessary reference to the code, it didn't allow you to get your hands dirty with it. There is nothing like being able to see the code in a real life scenario, and that is exactly what tutorials provide!

**One thing we knew for sure: everyone wants to see the code.**

#### What were our goals?

We had three goals for our tutorials:
1. **Simple UX**: This started with the design and bled all the way through to the words and phrasings we used. It had to be something that reflected one of the most important parts of the WeDeploy product itself: ease of use.
2. **Consistant Flow**: Most users come with a goal in mind of what they want to implement and what stack they want to implement it with. But what about after they build that first app? We wanted to create a consistent experience and content flow across all the tutorials so that users could easily learn about about other services that were not already familiar to them.
3. **Educational Content**: The end goal of each tutorial is deploying and interacting with a fully functional app, but we didn't want users to just get to the end, we wanted them to learn something. We spent hours, even days, coming up with the balance between the difficulty and educational takeaway of the tutorial, and we are very excited with the results.

#### What's in it for you?

Like we said above, each tutorial takes you all the way from clone to deploy in a matter of minutes. This not only gives you a inside look into specific details of the service you are interested in, but it also teaches you about other things like source code file structure, API methods, configuration files, deployment flow using git, and so much more.
