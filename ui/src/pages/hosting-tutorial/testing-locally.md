##### Testing locally

Now that we have the local environment running, let's test the project by making a change to it. 

Go back to the boilerplate in your text editor, open `index.html` and change the text inside the `<h1>` element from `It works!` to `You rock!`.

Save the file, go back to your browser, and refresh the page. You should see the text change to "You Rock! (because lets be honest, you do!).
