#### Deploy the project

With the API request ready and the CDN linked, we now just need to deploy the project so we can send an email.

Within `tutorial-email-web` on your command line, add a git remote by running `git remote add wedeploy http://git.wedeploy.com/<your-project-name>.git`.

Then make a first commit. 
1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "Awesome commit"`
3. `git push wedeploy master`

Once you push, WeDeploy will immediately start building and deploying your project.

Give it a few moments and then go to `hosting.<your-project>.wedeploy.io` to see what you deployed! Pretty cool, right? ðŸ˜Ž
