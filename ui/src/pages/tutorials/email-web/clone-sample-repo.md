###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Every WeDeploy project follows a similar file structure by using JSON files to managing your project and service-level configurations.

```xml
your-project
├── email
│   └── container.json
├── hosting
│   ├── container.json
│   └── index.html
└── project.json
```

You can see a similar file structure in the repo you just cloned. Want to know more about <a href="http://wedeploy.com/docs/intro/configuration-files.html" target="_blank">configuration files</a>?
