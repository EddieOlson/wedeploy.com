#### Send an email

Great work, your app is now live! ðŸš€ Now let's send an email.

1. Go to `hosting.<your-project>.wedeploy.io` in your browser.
2. Fill in the form (make sure you put your email in the "to" field)
3. Click submit and check your email inbox because you've got mail! ðŸ“¬

Awesome! You just deployed an app and sent an email within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!
