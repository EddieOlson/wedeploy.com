```

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Every WeDeploy project follows a similar file structure by using JSON files to managing your project, service, and data path configurations.

```xml
your-project
├── data
│   ├── api.json
│   └── container.json
├── hosting
│   ├── container.json
│   └── index.html
└── project.json
```

You can see a similar file structure in the repo you just cloned. Want to know more about [configuration files](/docs/intro/configuration-files.html)?
