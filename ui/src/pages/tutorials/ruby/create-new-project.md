#### Create new project

To begin, we will create a new WeDeploy project.

1. Go to the <a href="http://dashboard.wedeploy.com" target="_blank">WeDeploy Dashboard</a>
2. Click on _New Project_
3. Add a _Project ID_
4. Click _Create Project_

The ID you gave this new project is the ID you will add to all future `<your-project-id>` elements in this tutorial.
