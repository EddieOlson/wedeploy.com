#### Deploy Your App

Now the moment you have been waiting for - deployment!

Go to `tutorial-nodejs` in your terminal and deploy your project:

```xml
we deploy --project projectID
```

**Note:** make sure to replace `projectID` with the ID that you want for your project.

Now go to `app-<projectID>.wedeploy.io` in your browser and see your live page!
