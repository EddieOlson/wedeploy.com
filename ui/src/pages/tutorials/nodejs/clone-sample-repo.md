#### Clone Sample Repo

First, you'll clone a sample repo that contains the necessary files and directories for deploying a site.

To do this, run the command below in your terminal:

```xml
git clone https://github.com/wedeploy/tutorial-nodejs.git
```

In this example, we'll use [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as our web framework. Don't worry if you've never used this before, there's no need to learn or download anything.
