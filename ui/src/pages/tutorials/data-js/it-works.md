#### It works

Great work, your app is now live! ðŸš€ Now let's start playing with some data.

1. Go to `hosting.<your-project>.wedeploy.io` in your browser.
2. Type an item into the input and click _Add Item_
3. Click _Go to item listing_ and see how your data is already populated
4. To see the real-time data in action, open up both pages side-by-side and then add an item

Awesome! You just deployed an app and saved data within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

Do you have a primary UI service that you would like to be served by your project's main URL (`<your-project.wedeploy.io`)? Perfect, that is extremely easy to do by going to the settings tab of your project's dashboard and selecting a _Home Service_.
