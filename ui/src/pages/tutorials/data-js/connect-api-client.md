#### Including the API Client

Before we can make any requests to save or fetch data, we must connect the WeDeploy API Client.

To do this, go to `tutorial-data-js/hosting/` and include this script link at the bottom of the `<body>` element of `index.html` and `list.html`:

```xml
<script src="http://cdn.wedeploy.com/api/latest/wedeploy.js"></script>
```
