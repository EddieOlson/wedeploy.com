# Frequently Asked Questions

With every new product comes a lot of new questions.

## What is the WeDeploy?

The new WeDeploy aims to be your project's back-end, period. Ambitious, I know, but WeDeploy is a very versatile tool that does just that. WeDeploy allows you to create REST APIs instantly, add a powerful cloud database, use a fast static hosting, and leverage real-time capabilities in your app. Regardless of what platform you work with, you'll be able to use native SDKs for mobile, desktop, and IoT devices.

## Why should I use WeDeploy?

When building a high scalable application there are many things you need to consider: performance bottlenecks, database resiliency and scalability, authentication, authorization, and static hosting to name a few. WeDeploy is a new dynamic Liferay initiative, allowing you to handle all of your back-end challenges in one place. Focus on creating amazing user experiences, and WeDeploy will take care of the rest.

## How does WeDeploy interact with your existing Liferay Portal solution?

WeDeploy can be described as Liferay's API Gateway that can also be used standalone. WeDeploy provides an infrastructure to deploy micro-services in a managed cloud infrastructure. WeDeploy will have prebuilt adapters for Liferay services like document repository, content management, audience targeting, etc. You may create additional microservices that integrate with other enterprise applications like SAP, Salesforce, etc.

Using WeDeploy, you may augment your existing Liferay solution with real-time notifications and a cloud based microservices platform.

## Can I rely on WeDeploy for apps in production?

The closed developer preview version of WeDeploy is intended to collect developers feedback. We don't recommend you use it for production at this point.

## Can WeDeploy be installed on my own servers?

WeDeploy's initial goal is to provide Backend as a Service deployed in the cloud. Most of the complexities of scaling and fault tolerance of your application is automatically managed by WeDeploy.
