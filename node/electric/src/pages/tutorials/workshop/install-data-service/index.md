Nice job, you're app is coming along nicely. We are still missing a major piece though. Let's add the message data so that we can start messaging our friends in real time.

Just like we did with the Auth service, let's go to the WeDeploy Console again and install a Data service.

<ul class="checklist">
  <li>Go to the WeDeploy Console</li>
  <li>Select your app's project</li>
  <li>Click on the <em>Install Service</em></li>
  <li>Select the <em>WeDeploy Data</em> service</li>
  <li>Name your Data service <code>db</code></li>
  <li>Click <em>Install Data</em></li>
</ul>

Now your data service will initiate for a few seconds and then it will be ready for us to use.
