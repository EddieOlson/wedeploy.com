Great! Now you have added all the code you need to start creating new users and allowing them to login to your chat app. Lets try your app out locally so you can see the Auth service in action.

Go to Chrome (or your preferred web browser) and open the `index.html` file in your project folder.

Try going to the _Create Account_ page and creating a new user. Then, once you enter the chat page, you can logout with the arrow button in the top left of the chat screen and then try signing in with that user again.

Nice job, you're app is coming along nicely. We are still missing a major piece though. Lets add the message data so that we can start messaging our friends in real time.
