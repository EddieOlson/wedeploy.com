description: "Hyperlinks are like the hands of the web. They make it simple and easy for anyone to access your page, content, or application. Because of this, we have made hyperlinks a first-class citizen in the WeDeploy ecosystem so you can bring worldwide accessibility to whatever you are building."

#### The power of the URL

Picture this... 

You are working on a proof of concept for a new feature. It's almost done and you want to share it with your distributed team to get feedback but don't want to block your momentum by beginning a deployment procedure. What do you do?

Or maybe you just worked tirelessly over the weekend to build a homepage for your new side project. The problem is, you only have it on your local machine and you don't have the time, or energy, to push it live. What do you do?

The simple solution, **you need a URL**. By giving access to your project or application through a universally accessible protocol like a URL, you can easily share a simple string and allow your team, your friends, or the world to see what you are building no matter where they are or what device they're on.

But there is a still a big problem: what about the deployment? 

Somehow you need to get it live but you don't have enough time to become a part time devops master just to do it.

That is where we come in.

#### Our Obsession

One of our primary goals for WeDeploy is to help make web development easy and accessible. We have done this in many ways, but one is through our obsession with the hyperlink.

We've learned that if the primary way that people access the web is through URL's, why not make them an integral part of how our users build new applications. 

What if we made it such an essential part of the deployment process that you never thought about it? Wouldn't it be nice to move your project from local to live in a matter of seconds and have an automatic URL generated at the end to share. 

And what if this URL came with all the bells and whistles like automatic HTTPS certificates, full HTTP2 capabilities, and was consistent across all deployments so as your team gives you feedback, you can make changes, deploy again in a few seconds, and show them the updates without risking security or performance?

Us too, that's why [we built it](/docs/deploy/).

#### How Does It Work?

Think of WeDeploy as a DevOps team in your pocket. We remove the need for you to worry or even care about infrastructure nuances, because our team is taking care of that for you. All you need to do, is push your code to us and we'll do the rest. 

_Sound simple? That's because it is!_
